		<h5> Hi! My name is Martha, I’m 16 and go to Da Vinci Commutations. Some small things to know about me are  that I love the Sims and are over the moon aboout the band Panic! At The Disco. The style I got on the quiz is Rocker. I personally agree with this statement. I sometimes think I’m more of a punk rock type but either way I believe this is my fashion choice. I love wearing black and having a band t shirt is my groove. Eyeliner and hair dye are also parts of my life as well. And forgetting to add black heels or a chocker can ruin my look. Check out my look book down below to find out more about my fashion styles. ♥️ </h5>

		<h5> Hey, my name is Katie Pool and I’m a 16 year old student at Calabasas High School! Born and raised in the suburbs of LA, I have spent my entire life in the same house growing up alongside my four older siblings. As the youngest child, I struggled with standing out and personal expression among such a busy household. By establishing my own style, I developed myself as an individual and had fun simultaneously! I received “Trendy” on our style quiz which completely complements my style! Skirts, t-shirt dresses, jeans, leggings, and button down shirts are all necessities of my closet. I also enjoy regularly shopping and keeping my closet fresh and interesting! Check out my looks below!

		<h5>Hi, my name is Vivian. I’m 16 years old and I go to Hampton Roads Academy in Newport News, Virginia. On our style quiz, I got “VSCO” Style! VSCO is a popular photo editing app and resource for artistic inspiration.  I agree with this because I enjoy wearing a lot of outfits similar to the style (find these on the design page). I feel like accessories are a staple to the VSCO style as well as in my daily look. Personally, I love layering necklaces, bracelets, and other jewelry. However, I feel like my style crosses over into the “Artsy” territory. I like to paint and draw in my free time and I feel like my artistic eye is reflected in some of the pieces and color schemes that I wear. Check out a few of my outfits below!

		<h5>Hey, my name’s Daniela, I’m 16 and I go to school at Torres High School in East Los Angeles, CA. I love to play sports, but at the same time be girly.  On the fashion style quiz I got trendy and sporty, so I would say my style can range from a variety of things.  Depending on my mood, some days I’ll go for a more comfortable, athletic look and on other days I’ll go for a more dressy, fashionable look.  My fashion essentials would be white sneakers, ripped jeans, cropped shirts, and cute hair ties.  Look below if you relate to my style and want some outfit ideas.

		<h5>My name is Serenity and I’m a Senior. For the style studio quiz, I got ‘tomboy’. Tomboy is a perfect way to describe me because I like wearing sporty clothes that aren’t feminine or hard to put on and take off. Wearing makeup made me feel pretty some moments, but other moments where the makeup burn my face or when skirts and dresses were too tight, I wanted to be comfortable for a while. It was tough trying to be a “traditional girl” that wore dresses and looked cute all the time. And I noticed I slowly started leaning more on the tomboy side.
